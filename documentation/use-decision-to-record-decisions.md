## Context

We typically write documents that describe WHAT we want to do and or HOW we want to do it, but we often fail to describe WHY. Understanding the context behind the many small decisions we make can help to avoid confusion, conflict, and repeated work.

## Decision

We will record all significant decisions in Git through the  `decision` interface.

## Consequences

- We understand the context and motivations for decisions
- Decisions become explicit, and can be referenced with a URL
- We introduce a small amount of friction into decision making
