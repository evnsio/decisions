## Context

We share a roadmap with the rest of the company every quarter. Sometimes this gets shared externally too, e.g. with regulators. It&#39;s important that everyone is aligned on the big pieces of work we&#39;re doing.

## Decision

All changes to roadmap items that have been added to the collective level roadmap should be logged as decisions and shared in #platform-council.  Decisions will explain why we&#39;ve changed course, and what the impact is of the change.

## Consequences

- Collective leadership have an up-to-date view of what we&#39;re working on.
- We can refer back to these decisions to understand why they were made.
